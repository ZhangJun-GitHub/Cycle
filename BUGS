* Fertile days
    URL: https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1470777&group_id=107842&atid=648860
    Details: Hello,

    The calculation of the fertile days is a bit strange.
    If you have your ovulation the ovule only lasts for 24
    hours. 2 days after ovulation will be enough to enhance
    the fertile period. 5 days before ovulation is ok, 6
    would be better.

Feature requests
================

* Printing
    Details: Would be nice if we could print

* Strong/weak flow days mark
    URL: https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1933228&group_id=107842&atid=648863
    Details: Hi,

    I am a Fedora cycle package maintainer and I've got RFE from one of my users so that she would be able to distinguish in her calendar between days with a strong flow and weak flow.

    No idea how to do it GUI-wise though.

* Period length
    URL: https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1470778&group_id=107842&atid=648863
    Details: Hello,

    Normally you need to track, how long the period lasts.
    Now you can make a note, but that's not practical. It
    would be nice to say that was the first day and the
    period was x days long and see that in the calendar.

    Regards,
    Jenny

    PS: otherwise this could be a reason for me to learn
    Python :-)
